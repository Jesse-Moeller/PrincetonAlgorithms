# PrincetonAlgorithms
 This repository contains my solutions to exercises and assigments sourced from Princeton's Algorithms & Data Structures course.

Environment:
1. Install >= Java SKD 11
2. Add ".\algs4\algs4.jar" to the global variable CLASSPATH (may require restart)

Execution:
1. Navigate to ./CourseraAssignments/{assignment} according to your interest
2. if {assignment}.class is not present, run <code>javac {assignment}.java</code> to compile
3. run <code>java {assignment}</code> to see execution of main method in {assignment}
4. Some programs read in Standard Input. If you want use the unit test files, make sure to pipe: <code>cat .\tests\duplicates.txt | java Permutation 3</code>
