# PrincetonAlgorithms
 My exercises and assigments while taking Princeton's algorithms course on Coursera.

Environment:
1. Install >= Java SKD 11
2. Add ".\algs4\algs4.jar" to the global variable CLASSPATH (may require restart)

Execution:
1. Navigate to ./CourseraAssignments/{assignment} according to your interest
2. if {assignment}.class is not present, run <code>javac {assignment}.java</code> to compile
3. run <code>java {assignment}</code> to see execution of main method in {assignment}
4. Note: For programs that read in Standard Input, if you want to test the files provided by Princeton for unit testing, you need to pipe.
  a. Windows: <code>cat .\tests\duplicates.txt | java Permutation 3</code>  
  b. Unix: <code> java Permutation 3 < .\tests\duplicates.txt</code>
