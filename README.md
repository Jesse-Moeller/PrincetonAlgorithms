# PrincetonAlgorithms
 My exercises and assigments while taking Princeton's algorithms course on Coursera.

To reproduce:

Install >= Java SKD 11
add ".\algs4\algs4.jar" to the global variable CLASSPATH
(may require restart)

Navigate to one of the assignments folders inside of CourseraAssignments and run

javac {assignment}.java

to compile, then

java {assignment}

to get the output from the main method of the class (most likely whatever unit tests I was doing before submitting)
