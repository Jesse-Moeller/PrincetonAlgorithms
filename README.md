# PrincetonAlgorithms
 My exercises and assigments while taking Princeton's algorithms course on Coursera.

Environment:
1. Install >= Java SKD 11
2. Add ".\algs4\algs4.jar" to the global variable CLASSPATH (may require restart)

Execution:
1. Navigate to ./CourseraAssignments/{assignment} according to your interest
2. if {assignment}.class is not present, run javac {assignment}.java
3. run java {assignment}

This will produce output from the main method of the {assignment} class (most likely whatever unit tests I was doing before submitting)
